Space-Crusade-0.6
=================

Repository for working version (0.6A) of Space Crusade

This repository contains the latest working source code for Space Crusade,
an ambitious project being undertaken by Laughing Man Productions² to combine many of the greatest features
from many of the most popular Space RPG/4X/RTS/FPS/Simulation games and mesh them in an open world style system reminiscent
of Skyrim and Eve-Online.

Currently version 0.6A is in development and will be released in 3 to 4 months.

The current state of the game is in the form of a text-game.  This represents the backend of the 3D version of the game
and we like to consider it to be a verbose version of what will be going on behind the scenes once we reach the first version
of the game which will be in 3D in an actual game engine (version 1.0).

If you want to learn more about the project, get a feel for the universe the game is set in, see some behind the scenes looks at
the development of the game, or learn more in-depth information such as design goals or the development time line visit
the official website at http://sc.lmpgames.com or the Wiki section on our website at http://lmpgames.com/wiki/Category:Space_Crusade.

Please note that this code does not represent a finished product and that the code presented here is of an early Alpha build of the game.
As such there may be problems, bugs, incorrect code usage, or other such problems existant in the code.  If you want to report
any such problems please do so on our Bug Tracker at http://bugs.lmpgames.com/tbg/ or submit your own commits (but please let me know the changes you have made so I can credit you!).
